## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Description
This is primarily an exercise in manipulating the DOM. As a student at Udacity, this was the last
project for successfully completing the Front-End-Web-Development NanoDegree Course.

The project involves accessing the elements of a landing page, creating the navigation menu
using javaScript, and through JS program, functions, event listeners, dynamically manipulating 
the elements as the page is manipulated bia mouse clicks or scrolling.

## Features
* Dynamically build navigation menu with JS
* On click, dynamically update navigation menu items to indicate which item was clicked
* On click, dynamically scroll to selected section of page
* Dynamically set an "active state" flag for the section currently in the viewport


## Favorite

Setting the active class for the sections and highlighting the navigating tab was my
favorite aspect of building out the web page. For me there was a challeging learning 
process to determine how to select the proper element and compare based on a click or 
a scroll and the match up the element to be updated, as well as remove the class for 
elements not in focus.
